-Somewhat inspired by Twitter

-Currently this is just Web/Desktop First only as this is a passion/personal/learning project and i might add screen size handling later on if i find the
time (i.e media queries or some library to handle mobile/tablet side of things)

-React and Pure CSS for frontend styling (Mantine for loaders)

-Controlled input forms

-Redux for state management

-React Router for routing

-MongoDb as database

-Express & NodeJS based backend

-JWT authentication

-CRUD api's for users

-Checks to make sure that username is unique at time of registration

-Password encryption to make sure that passwords are encrypted when stored in database

-CRUD api's for posts

-Api's to get users specific or user following posts sorted by date

-Like and Dislike posts using api's

-User roles to make sure a user can only update/delete there own profile or if they are admin they can update/delete any

-Users can follow other users.

-When a user follows someone there following will increase. Meanwhile the user that got followed will get another follower in there follower list.

-Server storage for media uploading

-Socket.io implemented in order to implement realtime chat features like online status, auto get new messages and more (you can go to the messenger side
of the app by clicking on the message bubble on the top right of the app)

-Emojis in chat (including emoji search bar)

-Auto scroll on getting new messages in chat

-Currently can't send pictures/videos in chat but there is an icon and i might add that functionality at a later date if i come back to this 
project (maybe in SocialMedia 3.0?)

-There are alot of missing features that can be implemented if provided the enough time (like message notifications, like notifications, 
adding comments to posts(comment feature was present in Social Media 1.0), some loaders are also missing while fetching data)
